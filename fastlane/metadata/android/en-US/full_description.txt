KISS Launcher allows Android users to simplify the home of their interface, to purify their screens and access the functions they need as quickly and as simply as possible.

KISS Technology has been developed to allow users to save time and battery power.

KISS Android Launcher helps users find the most used features of their phones, to offer an adaptable reception service continuously depending on use patterns.

Search through your apps, contacts and settings lightning fast. No more time spent trying to find the app you want to launch: enter a few characters of the name and hit enter. Need to call someone? Don't meddle with the call log, just give three letters of their name and push the "phone" button. What you won't see is a lame grid of application icons that sit there doing NOTHING.

KISS becomes smarter and smarter as you use it, pushing forward results you're more likely to select.

Get ready to be amazed.
